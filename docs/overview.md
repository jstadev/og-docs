# Overview

**OG Tracker** is a common good tool that **tracks** the **deliverables** and the ongoing progress of approved **OpenGov** referenda. By continuously monitoring all approved proposals on [Polkadot](https://polkadot.com/), OG Tracker provides quick access to essential information through a very user-friendly and easy-to-navigate interface.

Our mission is to enhance accountability, establish **transparency-reports** or similar activities as the standard practice, report back to the community with our findings and improve the overall OpenGov experience for all parties involved. 

OG Tracker is powered by the Polkadot Treasury, witnessing a tremendous support and warm reception from the community (see REF [334](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/334) and [634](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/634)). 

We invite everyone to contribute to our mission and **JOIN THE TRACKING MOVEMENT** ðŸŸ£
