# Overview

**OG Tracker** is a common good tool that **tracks** the **deliverables** and the ongoing progress of approved **OpenGov** referenda. By continuously monitoring all approved proposals on [Polkadot](https://polkadot.com/), OG Tracker provides quick access to essential information through a very user-friendly and easy-to-navigate interface.

Our mission is to enhance accountability, establish transparency-reports or similar activities as the **standard practice**, report back to the community with our findings and improve the overall OpenGov experience for all parties involved. 

OG Tracker is powered by the Polkadot Treasury, witnessing a tremendous support and warm reception from the community (see REFs [334](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/334) and [634](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/634)). 

We invite everyone to contribute to our mission and **JOIN THE TRACKING MOVEMENT** 🟣
