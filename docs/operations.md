# OGT Operations

## **When does the OG Tracker platform get updated?**
Currently, the OGT app is updated every spend period (24 days). <br/>
This timing is beyond our control, as we need each proposal to be rewarded before it can be displayed in our app, allowing the duration bar to start.

However, proposals awarded in stablecoins, other REF without a request, and those from the origin tracks, are updated on a more regular basis.

## **PoW establishment file** 
Every proposal has specific tasks, and to ensure the accuracy of the information displayed in our app, we collect all relevant links associated with each task separately and compile them into our PoW (Proof of Work) establishment file. 

This file is stored in to our administration dashboard and contains all our findings and the proof for every deliverable marked as delivered in our app, along with all the transparency reports.
