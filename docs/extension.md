# Established Duration and Extension policy 

The established duration represents the expected timeframe for a proposal to be fully completed and delivered (it is initially stated by the proposers in their original referendum). In our app, this is displayed via a real-time duration bar that begins when the proposal receives its funding. We believe this approach is the most accurate, objective, and fair for everyone.

However, there are instances where proposers might miscalculate the scope of their work or encounter unexpected challenges and obstacles that result in delays. Such occurrences are considered normal and can arise for various reasons. This is why we offer an extension to any proposer, once they are responsive to our communications and the explained reasons for the delays are valid and reasonable.

## **Our Extension Policy:**
- The maximum extension period for a proposal is capped at two months.
- A proposal’s duration can be extended only once.
- If the deliverables are not met within this extended timeframe, the proposal will be flagged.

> **Note 1:** _The above method is commonly followed but is not the standard, as each proposal is unique and may require different treatment._

> **Note 2:** _Currently, the OG Tracker team is responsible for making these decisions based on what we consider fair and reasonable, but ultimately it is up to the Polkadot community to decide._

> **Note 3:** _Even though we offer the option to extend the duration, we always encourage proposers to take this matter seriously and focus on delivering within their initially established duration!_


## **Why is setting a legitimate duration so important?**

- Accurately calculating the time needed to complete your proposal and adhering to that timeline demonstrates a thorough understanding of your product. 
It shows you have conducted a deep research and presented a well-thought-out plan when requesting funding, taking into account all potential parameters and setbacks.

- The primary factor in the final funding request is often the working hours required multiplied by the hourly rate of the employees. 
Failing to accurately calculate and justify the project’s total duration suggests a lack of preparation and an attempt to manipulate numbers to secure a desired amount of funding.

- Time management is an essential skill, and anyone applying for funding through OpenGov should possess it or seek advice from more experienced individuals or teams.
Demonstrating effective time management not only reflects professionalism but also builds trust, indicating that the proposer has relevant experience and a solid background in managing such projects.
