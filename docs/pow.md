# Proof of Work Files  

Every proposal has specific tasks, and to ensure the accuracy of the information displayed in our app, we collect all relevant links associated with each task separately and compile them into our PoW (Proof of Work) establishment file.


These files are now available to everyone for evaluation. 

In every proposal, under the ‘’progress’’ section  you can find all our findings, from updates to final reports, whether gathered independently by our team or provided directly by proposers.

This information is unique, and we’re proud to be the only ones making it available!

Note: If any PoW is missing, it is because the proposal is still in progress or has received a negative badge with no proofs provided.
