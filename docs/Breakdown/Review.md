# OGT Review 

The OGT Review is a dedicated section within each proposal where the OG Tracker team provides **comments** and **insights** regarding the proposal. <br/>
This section is used to offer explanations about any modifications made to the proposal or to clarify specific details following in-depth communications with the proposers.

**Current Usage of the OGT Review:**
- _For flagged proposals._
- _For tasks marked with the remodel badge (!)._
- _To highlight any extensions in the duration of a proposal._

> **Note:** _All comments in the OGT Review are based on facts and do not reflect personal opinions._
