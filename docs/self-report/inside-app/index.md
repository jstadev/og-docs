Once connected, you will be directed to the dashboard. 

On the side bar, you will see all your approved proposals listed by their REF #Number.
<img src={require('@site/static/img/images/self-report/my-proposals.png').default} /> 

At the top, you will find **exclusive** data to your address, including:
- The total number of your approved proposals.
- The total amount of DOT received by this address.
- The overall status of your approved REFs (Delivered, In Progress, Flagged).

Click on the REF # for the proposal you wish to provide a report or update. 

After selecting the proposal, three tabs will appear:
- **My Report**
- **My Tasks**
- **Submission Log**

Let's break them down!
