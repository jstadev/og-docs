# My Tasks

In this section, you can provide updates or reports specific to **each task**, and even request edits if a task is inaccurate or changes have occurred compared to the original proposal.


When you click on the **''My Tasks''** tab, the expected deliverables of your proposal will be displayed. 

Each task will show a relevant status badge.
- Tasks that have been delivered will display the ✅ badge. These delivered tasks will be moved down on the page, and no further actions can be made once they are completed.
- For tasks that are still in progress, you will see the ⌛ badge, along with a **"pencil"** icon for editing requests and an **"add deliverables"** box for additional updates.
