# Add Deliverables

By clicking on the **"Add Deliverables"** box, you can provide updates about that exact task.
- Click the Add Deliverables box.
- Explain why this task has been completed by providing relevant information and links that verify your claim.
- Click Save.


After clicking the **"Save button"**, a confirmation pop-up will appear, indicating that your deliverable has been successfully saved. The OG Tracker team will then review it and either update the task status accordingly or contact you for further input.

> **Note:** *Submitting separate reports or updates for each task is just an optional step as you can share everything into a single-overall report through the My Report tab.* 
*However, providing an individual task report is considered good practice and would help accelerate our tracking process and execution.*
