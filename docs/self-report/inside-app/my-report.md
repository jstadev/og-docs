# My Report

This section consists of four fields: Title, Report URL,Comment, and Choose Files where you can provide updates on the status of your proposal. <br/>

**Breakdown:**
- **Title**: Specify the type of report or update. Examples:
    - Monthly/Bi-Monthly report (e.g., from June to July)
    - Quarterly report (e.g., January to April)
    - Milestone report (e.g., Milestone 2)
    - Final report
- **Report URL**: If your report is in a format such as Google Docs, Github, PDF, etc. provide the relevant link here. You can add multiple links by clicking the **"+"** button.
- **Comment**: Share any comments relevant to your report or important notes that will help us validate your submission faster and more efficiently.


Once you have completed your report, click the **‘’Save Report’’** button. 
A confirmation pop-up will appear, indicating that your report has been successfully saved.

> *As a next step, the OG Tracker team will then review your submission and either update the proposal’s status accordingly or contact you for further clarifications.*
