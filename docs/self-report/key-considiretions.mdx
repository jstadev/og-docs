# Key Consideration for Report Submission

- **Be accurate and concise:** Clearly explain the current status of your proposal, emphasizing the most important information based on the established deliverables in your original proposal.
- **Avoid altering original context:** When submitting a proposal, you outline certain deliverables. Use the same language in your report to avoid confusion and ensure clarity.
- **Provide proof of work links:** Attach all relevant links or other supported documents that demonstrate the validity of your claims. This is crucial for us in justifying your work and confirming its completion.
- **Share your metrics:** Include any metrics that demonstrate the results of your proposal. This valuable data can help the community better understand the impact of your proposal and may also be useful for future initiatives, such as the Auditor Collective.

By submitting a transparency report, you contribute to enhancing accountability within OpenGov. 

Letâ€™s work together to make this the standard practice for everyone!
