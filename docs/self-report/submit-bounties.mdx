# Submit reports for bounties and multisig

For bounties and multisig addresses, we have integrated **WalletConnect**, allowing anyone who is part of a multisig to connect independently into the Self-Report through Multix and provide relevant reports or updates.

Step by step guide:

1. Go to [**multix.chainsafe.io**](https://multix.chainsafe.io/) and connect with your wallet which is part of the Multisig.

1. Go to the Self-Report app and click on the ‘’Connect Wallet’’ button on the landing page and select the **‘’Wallet Connect’’** option.

1. Copy the Wallet Connect **URI**.

> **Note1:** *The same route is applied for proposals which have a **multisig** beneficiary address but they are not bounties.*

> **Note2:** *The report submission for bounties and multisig remains the same as the other proposals so visit the [**''Inside the self report app''**](./inside-app/) page to learn and better familiarise yourself with the process.*
