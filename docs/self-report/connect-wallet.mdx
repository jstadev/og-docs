# Connect your wallet

Go to [**report.ogtracker.io**](https://report.ogtracker.io) and connect your wallet. 

You can choose between four options: Nova, Talisman, Subwallet, and PolkadotJS.

Upon connecting your wallet, you will be able to view all your available eligible addresses.

It is important to highlight that access to the Self-Report Dashboard is restricted to the **beneficiary** and **proposer’s** address associated with the aproved proposal. 

However, we can grant access to additional addresses upon team’s request.
