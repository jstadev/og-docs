# OGT X (Twitter) Bot

Welcome to **OG Tracker X Bot**. 

An automated bot on X to track the duration of **Polkadot** approved proposals in real-time.

**How it works:**
When a proposal enters its final week, the bot automatically posts an update on X, tagging the proposers to notify them of the approaching deadline.

> Note: If the proposal is delivered before reaching the final week, no updates are posted to avoid unnecessary notifications or false alarms.

Follow the [X-Bot](https://x.com/ogtracker_bot) to stay informed about OpenGov proposals directly on your timeline!
