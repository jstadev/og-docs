# 🚩 Flagged Badge

The "**Flagged**" badge indicates that a proposal has not been successfully delivered for various reasons and is generally associated with a negative connotation. For a proposal to be marked as flagged, it must meet the following criteria:
- **Exceeded Deadline-Duration:** The proposal's deadline, including any applicable extensions, has been surpassed.
- **Lack of Information:** No relevant information regarding the execution/ completion of all or part of the deliverables has been shared by the proposer or found by the OG Tracker team.
- **Unresponsive Team:** The team is not responding to our calls or has ceased all contact.
- **Inadequate Explanations:** The team responds to our inquiries, but their replies are unclear or irrelevant.
- **Lack of Transparency:** No transparency report is provided, or there is no visible proof supporting/confirming their claims.



> **Note 1:** _For every flagged proposal, the OG Tracker team provides a comment in the OGT Review section explaining why the proposal has been flagged._


> **Note 2:** _A proposal's status can change from "Flagged" to "Delivered" if the proposer eventually fulfills the promised tasks._
