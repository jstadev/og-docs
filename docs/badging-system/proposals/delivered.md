# âœ… Delivered Badge

This badge indicates that the proposal and all its deliverables have been successfully completed. <br />

A proposal gets the "**Delivered**" status once our team has reviewed the provided report, or has independently gathered all the relevant information through extensive research. 

> **Note**: _Every proposal marked with this badge in the app is supported by proof of work (PoW) links that confirm the legitimacy of its completion._
