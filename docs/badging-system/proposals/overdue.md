# 🕐 Overdue Badge

The **Overdue** badge still carries a negative connotation but it's lighter than the Flagged badge.

The goal is to distinguish proposals that completely abandoned the project, from those that are continuously working on expected tasks, remain transparent and responsive but face unexpected difficulties or external obstacles that cause long delays.

For a proposal to be marked as overdue, it must meet the following criteria:


- Proposal's duration ended but is still not delivered
- Team is clearly working on the proposal
- The delays occurred due to third party involvement
- The team is responsive and fully transparent

Additionally the Overdue badge aims to kick-start the Community Voting initiative.

It is designed to increase decentralization in decision-making and empower the entire Polkadot community to actively participate in the validation process.

> **Note 1**: _For every overdue proposal, the OG Tracker team provides a comment in the OGT Review section explaining why the proposal has been overdue._
> **Note 2**: _A proposal's status can change from "Overdue" to "Delivered" or ‘’Flagged’’._
