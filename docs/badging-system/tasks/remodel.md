# ❕ Remodel Badge

The "**Remodel**" badge signifies that a task has minor modifications to the original plan.

This badge is awarded when a task has been substituted due to unforeseen events. For example, if a proposer committed to delivering 2 tutorial videos and 2 interviews but faced issues preventing the completion of the interviews, they might deliver 4 tutorial videos instead.

Each task marked with the "Remodel" badge is accompanied by a detailed comment from the OG Tracker team within the OGT Review section. This comment provides a clear explanation of the modifications made, including the reasons behind the changes.
