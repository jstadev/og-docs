# ðŸš© Flagged Badge

The "**Flagged**" badge signifies that a task has not been successfully delivered and is associated with a negative connotation.

> **Note:** _If a proposal is flagged, but the proposer has communicated that they are still actively working on the deliverables, the status of the tasks will remain "In Progress" and not "Flagged."_
